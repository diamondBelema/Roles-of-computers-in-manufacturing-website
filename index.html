        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Computers have transformed manufacturing by enhancing efficiency, precision, and automation. From Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) to AI-driven production, they reduce human error and optimize processes.</p>
        <p>Initially used for calculations and control systems, computers now enable automation, precision cutting, and faster production. CAD (Computer-Aided Design) improves product modeling, while CAM enhances machine operations.</p>

        <h2>Ancient vs Modern Manufacturing</h2>
        <p><b>Ancient:</b> Manufacturing relied on manual labor, handmade tools, and simple techniques. Production was slow, inconsistent, and prone to errors.</p>
        <p><b>Modern:</b> Automation, CAD/CAM software, and robotics ensure high precision, faster production, and improved quality. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables real-time monitoring, and AI enhances decision-making.</p>

        <h2>Roles of Computer in Manufacturing</h2>
        <h3>1. Supply Chain Management (SCM)</h3>
        <p>Technologies like AI, machine learning (ML), and IoT optimize demand forecasting, inventory management, and logistics.</p>

        <h3>2. Design and Prototyping</h3>
        <p>Digital prototyping allows engineers to test and modify designs in a virtual environment, ensuring faster iterations and better collaboration.</p>

        <h3>3. Production Automation</h3>
        <p>Automated machines use AI and software controls to improve efficiency, consistency, and speed in production lines.</p>

        <h3>4. Quality Control</h3>
        <p>AI-powered image recognition and machine learning identify defects in real time, reducing product errors.</p>

        <h3>5. Data Analytics & AI</h3>
        <p>Big data helps manufacturers analyze performance trends and optimize processes for better efficiency.</p>

        <h3>6. Robotics in Manufacturing</h3>
        <p>Industrial robots handle repetitive tasks with high precision, improving speed and consistency.</p>

        <h3>7. Internet of Things (IoT)</h3>
        <p>Connected devices in factories enable predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring of production.</p>

        <h3>8. Challenges & Limitations</h3>
        <p>Despite benefits, challenges like cybersecurity risks, high initial costs, and reliance on skilled labor exist.</p>
